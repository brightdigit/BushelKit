Dear App Reviewer,

Thank you for reviewing Bushel! Our app is designed to streamline app testing and development using macOS virtual machines.

Getting Started Instructions for Review:

1. **Onboarding & Library Creation**: After onboarding, users create a Library to manage macOS restore images, essential for setting up virtual machines.

2. **Importing Restore Images**: Users import restore images manually (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nVhFE4Qbzg)  or via the Hub (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzZGzH8vT4w), which are then displayed in the Library for VM creation.

3. **Creating a New Machine**: Users proceed to set up a virtual machine using the imported restore image, starting the installation process. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoodejj5gzw) 

4. **Starting the VM & Snapshot Functionality**: Users start the VM and utilize the snapshot feature for state capture and rollback.

Added Value with Bushel Pro Subscription:
- **Enhanced Snapshot Management**: Bushel Pro offers automatic periodic snapshots and snapshot-on-shutdown for added safety and ease.
- **Enhanced macOS Restore Image Handling**: Improved management of macOS restore images for seamless OS installations.

Please focus on evaluating the ease of Library creation, restore image import, virtual machine setup, and the added value brought by Bushel Pro's snapshot management features.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
